     <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
     <p>Mary Mauntz tends towards organic subjects like nature which is always surprising and amazing to her. Mauntz looks to pull a person from their knotted thoughts, feelings and forget themselves for a moment, just like a real landscape or a sky full of stars. It’s good to forget ourselves for a little while; to not feel like an outlander when visiting a beautiful place but to realize the fact that we’re a part of it. This kind of approach to art can help facilitate a respect for nature and fellow people. Mauntz looks forward to learning new programming skills in order to depict different mental disorders in an artistic way as well. She thinks it could help us see the beauty and mystery in others rather than strangeness and fear. There are so many people who don’t consider themselves participants of nature and that is not only bad news for our souls but also for the planet we occupy. </p>
     <p> Mauntz doesn’t always know what she will make when she sits down with her materials (usually acrylic paint). She'll just have some lines or color themes that are playing in the back of her head and get the urge to exercise them. Then, once it’s all said and done, she releases the artwork. It is no longer hers at that point but everyones'. Once she steps away from a piece, it doesn’t belong to her as no blade of grass is really owned by anyone else. We’re all interacting with and existing within the same world; Mauntz sets out to help people realize and appreciate that. </p>
